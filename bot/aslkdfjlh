a "meta" card variant type:

frontend stays the same, every collection option is still language + condition + variant type, except that now variant type is the "meta" card variant type

sort of what we were talking about about making the card variants many to many with themselves, but instead of being self referential you have something like this:

variants table:
cosmos holo: 1
jumbo: 2
yellow a alternate: 3

meta table, many to 1 with variants:
1: 1
1: 2
1: 3
